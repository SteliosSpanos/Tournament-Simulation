# Tournament Simulation
I made a simulation of a classic tournament elimination formula in order to practice my skills and by curiosity of how are these simulations made.
i focused more on the code being functional rather than making calculated comparisons between the teams.

## What I Learned
- How I can implement OOP(Object Oriented Programming) in something that we come across every day.
- How do these simulations function behind the scenes.
